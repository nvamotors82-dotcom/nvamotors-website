The AI engineer successfully built a modern car dealership website for NVAMOTORS, initially as a frontend-only clone with mock data, then integrated a FastAPI backend with MongoDB. The development progressed through several stages: initial frontend build based on a general understanding of Dealercenter given screenshot issues, mock data implementation, email update, extensive design enhancements (logo, founders, address, phone, new pages: FAQ, Promotions, Custom Search, multi-language, finance calculator, test drive scheduler), backend integration, and finally, full backend-frontend data synchronization with API calls. The process included rigorous frontend and backend testing, with the AI engineer troubleshooting frontend rendering and import issues. The current state is a highly functional, bilingual, and aesthetically polished MVP. The most recent task involved implementing an email and SMS/WhatsApp notification system (using SendGrid and Twilio) and then, in response to the user's lack of hosting/budget, outlining a free deployment strategy using EmailJS and Vercel. The AI engineer is currently guiding the user through the EmailJS setup.

<product_requirements>
NVAMOTORS requested a modern car dealership website, initially a frontend replica of Dealercenter, later evolving into a full-stack application. The core problem was to create a feature-rich, dynamic, and professional online presence. Key requirements included:
*   Frontend design replication with a modern aesthetic, responsive behavior, and interactive elements.
*   Integration of company branding:  email, professional logos (with relief effect), updated address (2539 E Fremont Street, Las Vegas, NV 89104), phone ((702) 501-9216), and founders (Niovanys Valdes, Ana G, Seth Lennet).
*   New pages/sections: FAQ (searchable, custom questions), Promotions/Offers, and a Custom Vehicle Search form.
*   Multi-language support (Spanish/English) across the entire site.
*   Interactive tools: A financing calculator for payments and a test drive scheduler.
*   Backend development with a MongoDB database for dynamic data (vehicles, testimonials, promotions, FAQs, contact messages).
*   Automated frontend and backend testing.
*   Recently requested: Email and SMS/WhatsApp notification system for contact and test drive forms, specifically using  and .
*   Most recently: Guidance on free hosting and a free email notification solution (EmailJS) due to budget constraints.

-   : **NEW** file. Defines the Pydantic model for a test drive scheduling request, capturing details like vehicle ID, preferred date/time, and user contact information. This is crucial for validating and storing test drive requests in the database.
-   : **NEW** file. Implements FastAPI endpoints for scheduling test drives. It uses the  model for request validation and integrates with the new  to send alerts upon successful scheduling.
-   : **NEW** directory and file. Centralizes logic for sending email (via SendGrid) and SMS (via Twilio) notifications. This modular approach allows easy integration across different routes and simplifies API key management.
-   : Modified to include environment variables for , , , , , and . These variables are essential for configuring the notification services without hardcoding credentials.
-   : Updated to import and utilize the  to send email and SMS alerts when a contact form is submitted.
-   : Updated to include notification support, likely for when a user submits a custom FAQ question or interacts with the FAQ section in a way that warrants an alert.
-   : Modified to import and include the new  router, making the test drive API endpoints accessible.
-   : **NEW** file. A React component designed to visually inform users about the active notification system, specifying email and SMS capabilities and the expected response time.
-   : Modified to import and render the  component, providing immediate transparency to users submitting contact forms about how their message will be handled. Also, corrected import path for .
-   : Corrected import path for  from  to .
-   : **Corrected path.** This file defines the  used for multi-language support across the application. The directory name was consistently  (plural) but was erroneously referenced as  (singular) in some files, leading to compilation errors.
-   : Updated to include  and  libraries.

<pending_tasks>
- No explicit pending tasks were outlined by the user at the end of the trajectory regarding the application's core features.
- The immediate pending task is to continue guiding the user through the EmailJS setup, specifically configuring EmailJS services and templates.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's request for implementing email and SMS/WhatsApp notifications and their subsequent need for a free hosting and notification solution due to budget constraints.

The AI engineer successfully:
1.  Integrated SendGrid and Twilio into the backend for email and SMS notifications, respectively.
2.  Created  to abstract notification logic.
3.  Updated  with placeholders for API keys.
4.  Integrated the notification service into , , and added a new  route and  model.
5.  Developed a frontend component, , to display information about the activated notification system on .
6.  Troubleshot and fixed a critical frontend compilation error related to incorrect import paths for the  (from  to ) in  and .

After successfully verifying the notification system's implementation (gracefully failing without actual API keys), the user requested guidance on making the application functional with free options for hosting and notifications. The AI engineer proposed a plan including Vercel for hosting and EmailJS for free email notifications.

The current work involves the initial steps of implementing the **EmailJS (GRATIS) solution**. The AI engineer has just provided the user with instructions on how to create an EmailJS account (Step 1) and is about to detail PASO 2: Configurar EmailJS.
